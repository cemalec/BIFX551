I am pursuing bioinformatics to be able to link the lab with the heavy computational anaylsis that is needed to find links between biomarkers and disease states. The multiple grants that I am working on purtains to CTE and concusions either with vet blast victims and athlete. 

* Reasons for pursuing Bioinformatics program:
  * machine learning
  * Finding a way to link biormakers to disease states
  * Increase pay from wet lab work
