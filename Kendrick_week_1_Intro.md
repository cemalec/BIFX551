Hello my name is Nick Kendrick,

The company that I work for is Meso Scale discovery http://mesoscale.com and I am part of the grant research group.

I am pursuing bioinformatics to be able to link the lab with the heavy computational anaylsis that is needed to find links between biomarkers and disease states. The multiple grants that I am working on pertains to CTE and concussions either with vetern blast victims and athletes. 

* Reasons for pursuing Bioinformatics program:
  * machine learning
  * Finding a way to link biormakers to disease states
  * Increase pay from wet lab work
  
  The image below is the difference between a normal brain and someone who has CTE.

number |Reasons why to program
------------ | -------------
1 | machine Learning can be taught from the data that I provide to it by either giving it commands or yes/no answers  
2 | by being able to manipulate the data I can link biomarkers and the disease state to develop platforms to test with patients
3 | we all love getting payed more and love windows
