I am pursuing bioinformatics to be able to link the lab with the heavy computational anaylsis that is needed to find links between biomarkers and disease states. The multiple grants that I am working on purtains to CTE and concusions either with vet blast victims and athlete. 

*Reasons for pursuing Bioinformatics program:
  *machine learning
  *Finding a way to link biormakers to disease states
  *increase pay from wet lab work
