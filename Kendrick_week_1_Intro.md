Hello my name is Nick Kendrick

I am pursuing bioinformatics to be able to link the lab with the heavy computational anaylsis that is needed to find links between biomarkers and disease states. The multiple grants that I am working on purtains to CTE and concusions either with veterns blast victims and athlete. The company that I work for is Meso Scale discovery http://mesoscale.com 

* Reasons for pursuing Bioinformatics program:
  * machine learning
  * Finding a way to link biormakers to disease states
  * Increase pay from wet lab work

number |Reasons why to program
------------ | -------------
1 | machine Learning can be taught from the data that I provide to it by either giving it commands or yes/no answers  
2 | by being able to manipulate the data I can link biomarkers and the disease state to develop platforms to test with patients
3 | we all love getting payed more and love windows
