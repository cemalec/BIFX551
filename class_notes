functions(argument)
eg: mean(1:3)
1 2 3
1:3 shortcut in r to make a list of numbers

> 1:6+1
[1] 2 3 4 5 6 7
> 1:6+1:6
[1]  2  4  6  8 10 12
> 1:3 * 1:3
[1] 1 4 9

Boolean TRUE, FALSE are capitalized

sample( 1:6, size, replace=TRUE)
> sample(1:6,size=2,replace=TRUE)
[1] 5 3

Data types:
(0) boolean, integer, float, strings(char)
(1) atomic vector myvector=c(1,2,3,4)  Same type for each element
> c("a","c","g","t")
[1] "a" "c" "g" "t"
> c("a","c","g",1)
[1] "a" "c" "g" "1"

a list is a vector that can hold multiple data types

(2) matrices matrix( c(1,2,3,4),nrows=2)
  > matrix( c(1,2,3,4),nrow=2)
       [,1] [,2]
  [1,]    1    3
  [2,]    2    4

(3) arrays - multiple dimensions
(4) factors 2cyl, 4cyl, 6cyl   mice=m,f  
(5) DataFrame has named columns and rows if needed.

Random Samples and Permutations

Description:

     ‘sample’ takes a sample of the specified size from the elements of
     ‘x’ using either with or without replacement.

Usage:

     sample(x, size, replace = FALSE, prob = NULL)

     sample.int(n, size = n, replace = FALSE, prob = NULL,
                useHash = (!replace && is.null(prob) && size <= n/2 && n > 1e7))

Arguments:

       x: either a vector of one or more elements from which to choose,
          or a positive integer.  See ‘Details.’

       n: a positive number, the number of items to choose from.  See
          ‘Details.’

    size: a non-negative integer giving the number of items to choose.

 replace: should sampling be with replacement?

    prob: a vector of probability weights for obtaining the elements of
          the vector being sampled.

 useHash: ‘logical’ indicating if the hash-version of the algorithm
          should be used.  Can only be used for ‘replace = FALSE’,
          ‘prob = NULL’, and ‘size <= n/2’, and really should be used
          for large ‘n’, as ‘useHash=FALSE’ will use memory
          proportional to ‘n’.
