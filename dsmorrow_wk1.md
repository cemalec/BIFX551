Hello, my name is Destinee Morrow.
I choose the bioinformatics program because I wanted to continue my career with out pursuing my PhD.
Here are some reasons behind this.
1. I didnt want to pursue the original plan of going to Vet School.
1. I wanted to move back home to MD from NC.
1. I wanted to advance in a career that was growing and would pay well.
