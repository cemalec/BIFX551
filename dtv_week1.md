Assignment:Fork the class repository, create a new markdown file called "your_initials_week1.md" and write a short explanation of why
you are in the bioinformatics program. 
Use a list, a picture, a link, and a table. Then send me a pull request.

Why am I in the Hood Bioinformatics program?  To help my with my work in Bioinformatics.  I would like to learn R and become fluent in git. I currently work for ![Battelle](/battelle.logo.png ) at Battelle National Biodefense Institute (BNBI) on Fort Detrick.
