# Week 1 Assignment

## Why I am in this program
I am in this program because I'd like to gain a more complete picture of the next generation sequencing process.
I understand and perform much of the wetlab work, and am looking to fill in some of the mystery around the data.
I also learned that I like the instant gratification that comes with programming, especially as a contrast to some experiments I perform.
For a glimpse into the kind of things I do, check out [this news article](https://www.statnews.com/2018/10/16/phage-therapy-viruses-carl-merril-navy/).
