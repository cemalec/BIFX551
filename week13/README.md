# Your portfolio:
- Put every project in a separate, labeled repository
- Insert a REAME.md file into each repository that summarizes the project (problem statement, methods, conclusions)
- If there are files or links that the reader should view, put them in the README and make them easy to find
- Clean up your code and add comments so that someone who is technically literate, but not an expert in the subject matter of your project can understand your process
- Include documents related to the project such as slides or papers
- Get rid of 'extra' files that don't relate to the project, or are out of date
- Bonus points: Create a github pages site for your portfolio, perhaps using an attractive [theme](https://jekyllthemes.io/)

# Using Jekyll Themse:
- Fork the repository
- Rename the repository to my_repo (or whatever you want)
- Commit to the gh-pages branch
- You now have a site at github.**user_name**.io/my_repo
