## Dataset 1 - Waterfowl Brood Data 2012-2013

This is a dataset of observations of brood size, life stage, time, and location of various waterfowl.  It also includes codes for the 
observer as well as notes about the observation.  While there's definitely some messyness about the location and notes data, this dataset 
could draw some interesting observations about the relationship between species, time, and brood size, as this data is more consistent 
across the dataset.

This dataset is mostly qualitative data, but does have a quantitative measure of brood size.

```{r}
download.file("https://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/DownloadFile/56761?Reference=55983", "waterfowl.csv")
waterfowl <- read.csv("waterfowl.csv")

head(waterfowl)
summary(waterfowl)

plot(waterfowl$X..of.chicks ~ waterfowl$Species)
```

## Dataset 2 - Quivira NWR Eagle Observations 1987-2009

This dataset includes total observed number of bald and golden eagles (and one random osprey observation) on a given day at the Quivira 
National Wildlife Reserve.  It also includes numerical data of the number of adult and juvenile individuals observed.  It does have places 
for observer data and notes but the data is spotty.  The most reliable questions that this data could be useful in answering would be total
observation of a species over time, as the life stage and location data are not realiably reported in this dataset.

```{r}
download.file("https://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/DownloadFile/58701?Reference=57710", "eagle.csv")
eagle <- read.csv("eagle.csv")

head(eagle)
summary(eagle)

plot(eagle$Number ~ eagle$X.1)
```

## Dataset 3 - North American Bat Monitoring Program Acoustic Monitoring Survey on NWRs

This dataset is on the accoustic data collected in a bat monitoring project in National Wildlife Refuges.  It has their SonoBat files and 
observed information from the audiofiles (calls/sec, frequencies, audio quality), as well as locational information in logitude/latitude, 
observer information, and technical information of the equipment and software used to take and analyze information.  

This is my favorite dataset for two main reasons.  First, it was the only one were the numerical data uploaded in a way that R immediately 
recognized as numerical data, which made it easier to immediately work with than the other two.  Second, despite some of the information 
still being patchy, this has by far the most information in the dataset itself that would allow for these observations to be repeated.  By 
including their observations in the audio file, their interpretation, and all of the equipment and software information, this is the only 
dataset that I think would be extremely useful for other researchers to use.

I decided to look at frequency of bat calls observed by the park locations at which observations were being taken.

```{r}
download.file("https://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/DownloadFile/161176?Reference=108547", "bat.csv")
bat <- read.csv("bat.csv")

head(bat)
summary(bat)

plot(bat$calls.sec ~ bat$ParkCode)
```
