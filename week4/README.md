# Reproducible Research
Reproducible research in a nutshell means creating an automated workflow so that the same data leads to the same results without human fallibility interfering with the analysis process. Reproducible research doesn't defend against bad data, incompetent analysis, or scientific dishonesty, but it prevents you accidental copy+paste to the wrong excel sheet from destroying your project. To help you get more into the Reproducible mindset, here is Roger Peng's 3 part series (don't worry, the parts aren't long). He's in the Hopkins biostats department and is a big proponent of the concept.

# Tidyr
Tidyr is great for tidy data and making tables longer and wider with pivot_longer and pivot_wider.
```{r}
#pivot_wider takes a pair of columns that are acting as 'labels' and 'values' and turns them into
#a tidy dataframe with named columns and rows that represent the same type of data
pop.csv <- download.file(url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cemalec/BIFX551/master/week3/SYB62_1_201907_Population%2C%20Surface%20Area%20and%20Density.csv','pop.csv')

library(readr)
pop_df <- read_csv('pop.csv',skip=1)

library(tidyr)
wide_pop_df <- pivot_wider(data = pop_df, names_from = 'Series',values_from = 'Value')

#pivot_longer collapses several columns into two containing the column names as well as the values in those columns.
#This is typically used to make the data more presentable.
original_pop_df <- pivot_longer(data = wide_pop_df, 
                                cols = c('Population mid-year estimates (millions)':'Population density'),
                                names_to = 'Series',
                                values_to = 'Value')
```

# Dplyr
Dplyr is for general data manipulation. The main functions in dplyr are select, arrange, filter, mutate, and summarize. Dplyr is also most people's first encounter with the 'pipe' operator, or %>%. The pipe operator essentially places the object to the left of the pipe as the first argument of the function to the right of the pipe. So x %>% f(y) = f(x,y)
```{r}
#filter pulls rows out of a dataframe
iris_setosa <- filter(iris, Species == 'setosa') #returns only rows from the 'setosa' species
library(stats)
iris_wide <- filter(iris, Sepal.Width > quantile(Sepal.Width,0.75)) #returns only rows in the upper quartile of sepal width

#arrange places rows in a different order
iris_bySepalLength <- arrange(iris, Sepal.Length) #Sorts rows by increasing sepal length
iris_bySepalLength <- arrange(iris, desc(Sepal.Length)) #Sorts rows by decreasing sepal length
iris_bySepalLengthAndSpecies <- iris %>% group_by(Species) %>% arrange(Sepal.Length) #Sorts within species groups

#select pulls columns out of a dataframe, can also be used to rearrange columns

#mutate creates calculated columns from other data columns

#mutate's friend transmute creates a dataframe with only the calculated columns

#summarize performs aggregating functions on groups of data. It most often must be paired with group_by to reach
#its full potential.
```
# Assignment

Find **Three** biological data sources that you can use for your first project. 
- For each write about why you find the dataset interesting, anticipated difficulties, and a question you would like to answer. 
- Perform a precursory exploration (types and amount of different variables and a simple graph) for each dataset.
- Hand in your results in an R Markdown document.
