```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r, eval = TRUE, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
abalone <- read.csv('abalone.data.txt')
ab_summary <- abalone %>% group_by(Sex) %>% summarise(Length = mean(Len), Height = mean(Hgt), Diameter = mean(Dia))
print(ab_summary)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = abalone) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = Sex, y = Ring))
```

This graph show much more overlap between the age of infant and mature abalone than I was expecting.  Infants may need to be excluded from further analysis.

```{r}
ggplot(data = abalone) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Ring, y = Len)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = Ring, y = Len), se = FALSE)
```

This graph show the general shape of the trend and the possibility that polynomial regression will likely be needed. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = abalone) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = Ring, y = Dia, color = Sex)) +
  facet_wrap(~ Sex)
```

This graph appears to show that while male and female abalone follow roughly the same relationship between age and diameter, infant abalone follow a seperate one.

```{r}
ggplot(data = abalone) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = Ring, y = Wh.Wt, color = Sex))
```

This graph appears to show the same distinction for weight.
