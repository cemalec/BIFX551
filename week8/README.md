# R Packages

R has a lot of packages, and odds are, if you stick around in bioinformatics long enough, you'll end up making some. Maybe they'll get hundreds of thousands of downloads on C-RAN, maybe it'll just be you and your colleagues, either way, packaging your useful functions is an effective way to pass your workflows to others.

# Assignment
1) Make a minimal R package using R Studio. The package should have two functions in a .R file (or two .R files) and a .Rd file for each function in the /man folder. It doesn't matter what the functions do, they can add two numbers or return the last two characters of a word, just as long as they are documented and part of a loadable package. [This is a very concise explanation](https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/) or how to make a minimal R package. Sorry if you don't like cats, but this is essentially exactly what I would like you to do for this assignment.

2) Look at one of the packages in the Tidyverse on github, [like tidyr](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyr). Open the test folder and find the test for a function you are familiar with, what is one test that seems obvious, what is one that seems less obvious. Also look at one vignette, how is this similar to reports you have written in R-markdown. Is the data used in the vignette available in the same folder?

3) Hand in you package as a repo on the **homework** branch of week8. It should have a .R and a man folder. Include a .md file with your repsonse to question 2.

# Your next project
Create another reproducible report. This time the audience will be for a 'business user' who may not be as concerned about the details of your analysis and every piece of supporting information. This should be 1-2 pages without code, 2-3 figures, and a statistical test. I've attached an example. Due **April 17th**.
